# Status Pointer

The rolling status summary is maintained in `docs/product/status.md`.

- The November 12, 2025 snapshot and earlier logs are preserved in `docs/archive/current_status_2025-11-12.md` and the Phase 1.2 archive at `docs/archive/2025-11-02-phase12/`.
- Whenever you publish a new status, update `docs/product/status.md` and move the superseded snapshot into `docs/archive/`.
