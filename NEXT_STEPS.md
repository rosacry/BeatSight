# Next Steps Pointer

Active backlog, blockers, and priority options live in `docs/product/status.md`.

- Historical planning packets are archived under `docs/archive/next_steps_2025-11-12.md` and the Phase 1.2 session bundle in `docs/archive/2025-11-02-phase12/`.
- When you roll a new plan, refresh `docs/product/status.md`, update `docs/product/roadmap.md` for structural changes, and move the previous snapshot into `docs/archive/`.
