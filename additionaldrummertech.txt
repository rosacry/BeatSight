Techniques/Timbres/Gestures that I listed:
Flam: A grace note followed immediately by a primary stroke, creating a thicker, two-hit sound.
Roll: Rapid repeated strokes (single, double, or buzz) to sustain a continuous tone on a drum.
Rimshot: Striking the drumhead and rim simultaneously for a loud, cracking accent.
Cross-stick: Resting the stick on the snare head and clicking the rim with the tip for a woody, clicky tone.
Crash-build (any cymbal): Repeated or alternating cymbal hits that crescendo to build intensity into a section.
Cymbal choking: Grabbing the cymbal right after striking it to cut off the sustain abruptly.
Crash-riding: Keeping time on a crash cymbal with repeated strokes, typically for high-energy sections.
Rim clicks: Hitting just the rim (often with the stick tip/shoulder) for a sharp, percussive click.
Ghost notes (snare): Very soft, low-volume strokes between main hits to add feel and texture.
Hi-hat barking / continuous barking + splash: Quick open–close “bark” accents (repeated in time for continuous barking); a hi-hat splash is a foot-opened, longer, airy “fsshh” sound.
Accent–tap / flow sticking: Alternating loud and soft notes (often with Moeller motion) to shape groove and dynamics.

Techniques/Timbres/Gestures that GPT listed (and added onto):

Snare & Rudimental Articulations:
Drag / Ruff: Two (or more) soft grace notes preceding a primary stroke for a gritty, lead-in sound.
Double-stroke (Diddle): Rapid RR/LL pairs that create the tight, even shimmer distinct from single strokes.
Buzz/Press Roll: Multiple bounces per hand for a sustained, papery snare tone (different from open doubles).
Dead Stroke (Muffle Stroke): Stick stays on the head after impact to produce a short, thuddy attack.
Stick Shot (Shot): One stick strikes the head while the other is braced on the rim, yielding an explosive accent.
Snares-Off Playing: Snare wires disengaged for a tom-like, dry voice (often used for dynamic contrast).
Hi-Hat Specific
Foot “Chick”: Closing the hats purely with the pedal for a tight, percussive chick without stick attack.
Half-Open / Degree-of-Open Hats: Controlled gap between cymbals for steady “sizzle” versus tight chick.
Hi-Hat Lift: Slightly opening the hats at impact to add wash, then re-closing to re-tighten the groove.
Tambourine-on-Hi-Hat: Hardware or clip-on jingles add a bright jingle layer to each hat motion.
Ride/Crash/Other Cymbals
Bell Accents / Bell-to-Bow Orchestration: Alternating bell “ping” and bow “wash” to shape lines timbrally.
Tip vs Shank Articulation: Playing with the stick tip (pingy) or the shoulder/shank (washy) for clear timbre shifts.
Mallet Swells (Cymbal Rolls): Soft mallets on cymbals for seamless crescendos without discrete stick attacks.
Sizzle Ride (Rivets/Chain): Built-in rivets or a chain produce sustained buzz that changes decay character.
Cymbal Scrape: Dragging the stick tip along the edge/bow for a rising, shimmering scrape effect.
Cymbal Stack Hits: Tight, stacked cymbals yield a short, trashy burst distinct from standard crashes.
Tom Techniques
Tom Rimshot: Hitting head + rim on a tom for a sharp, cracking accent different from center hits.
Hand-Muted Toms: Palm or fingers damp the head at impact for tight, conga-like attacks.
Timpani-Style Pitch Bend: Pressing the head while striking to momentarily raise pitch on floor/ride toms.
Floor-Tom Ride: Timekeeping on a floor tom (often with muffling) for a deep, tribal groove bed.
Bass Drum (Kick) Articulations
Feathering (Jazz 4-on-the-floor): Very soft quarter-note pulses that support feel without obvious attack.
Beater Bury vs Rebound: Holding the beater on the head (short/woody) versus letting it rebound (rounder).
Double-Kick Bursts: Rapid consecutive pedal strokes (single or double pedal) for machine-gun accents.
Heel-Down vs Heel-Up: Foot posture that changes attack speed, dynamics, and low-end length.
Slide/Swivel Doubles: Foot techniques enabling fast consecutive hits with a single pedal for distinct spacing.
Brush / Mallet / Stick-Type Colors
Brush Sweeps/Stirs: Continuous circular or lateral brush motion for a whispery, sustained texture.
Brush Taps/Flicks: Articulated brush strikes that mix click attack with quick, airy decay.
Toms with Mallets: Round, orchestral thumps with soft attack and low overtone hash.
Rods/Hot Rods: Bundled dowels reduce attack harshness for a dry, low-volume stick timbre.
Time-Feel & Subdivision (Audio-Detectable)
Swing/Triplet Feel: Eighths subdivided into triplets for lilted forward motion (vs straight).
Shuffle (incl. Half-Time Shuffle): Swung grid with spaced backbeats and dense ghosting in between.
Half-Time vs Double-Time Feel: Snare placement shifts (on “3” vs “2&4” feel) without changing actual tempo.
Polyrhythms / Polymeter: Simultaneous conflicting subdivisions or meters that cycle against each other.
Hemiola: 3-over-2 (or 2-over-3) accent pattern that re-groups pulses without changing tempo.
Odd-Groupings (5s/7s/9s): Quintuplet/septuplet phrasing and fills with non-binary subdivisions.
Linear Drumming: No simultaneous limb hits—each note isolated—for ultra-clear transient parsing.
Backbeat Displacement: Moving the snare accent off the usual 2/4 to create tension and release.
Metric Modulation: Re-interpreting the pulse so a subdivision becomes the new beat without a tempo jump.
Sticking Vocabulary (Common, Sonically Telling)
Paradiddle Family: Alternating single/double combos (RLRR LRLL, etc.) that imprint a signature accent map.
Paradiddle-Diddle: Paradiddle ending with RR or LL, yielding flowing, triplet-friendly phrasing.
Herta: Fast single-single-double (e.g., R L RR) burst used in fills and transitions.
Swiss Army Triplet: Flam-accented triplet with a distinctive lilt (common in funk/fusion).
Bonham Triplets: Orchestrated triplets (often R L K) with a heavy, rolling cadence.
Flam Taps / Flam Accents / Flamacue: Flam-based rudiments that color accents with a widened attack.
Orchestration & Prep/Muting
Tea-Towel/Wallet Muting: Cloth or wallet on heads to shorten sustain and darken tone (Ringo-style).
Moongel/External Dampers: Small gels or clips that reduce ring and overtones for controlled decay.
Snare-Wire Tension Changes: Loose vs tight wires change sizzle length and buzz sensitivity across the kit.
Cáscara on Shells: Sticking patterns played on drum shells or rims for dry, clave-oriented textures.
Riveted/Chain-Sizzled Crashes: Crash cymbals fitted with rivets/chain for instant, long tail fizz.
Style/Genre-Flagging (High-Value for Detection)
Train Beat: Alternating snare/ghosts with steady hats (or brushes) evoking locomotive motion.
Blast Beat (and Variants): Extreme fast alternation of kick/snare/cymbal creating a continuous wall.
Spang-a-Lang Ride: Classic jazz ride phrasing (ding-ding-da-ding) that defines swing feel.
Crash-Bell Punctuation: Strategic bell stabs inside ride or crash-ride patterns to lift phrases.
