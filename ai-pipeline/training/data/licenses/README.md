# Dataset License Summaries

Record one Markdown file per dataset in this directory using the naming pattern `<dataset>.md`. Each file should cover:
- Source URL or acquisition channel
- License name and version
- Redistribution terms or restrictions
- Notes on commercial use, derivative works, and attribution requirements
- Contact or takedown procedures when provided by the licensor
- Date the terms were last verified

Include direct quotations only when the license allows reproduction; otherwise paraphrase the key obligations and link to the canonical terms. When access is gated by credentials or contributor agreements, store the agreement identifier and retrieval path in the provenance entry, not in this directory.
