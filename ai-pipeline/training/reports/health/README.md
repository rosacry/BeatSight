# Dataset Health Reports

This directory stores generated JSON/HTML summaries from `dataset_health.py` and CI readiness runs. Outputs are ignored by default—only this README is tracked—so that large report batches do not bloat the repository. Archive any release-critical baselines elsewhere (for example `training/reports/baselines/`) or export the relevant metrics into version-controlled markdown.
