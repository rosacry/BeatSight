# Example Beatmap: Handcrafted Groove Demo

This curated beatmap mirrors the lane layout and cadence produced by the AI generation pipeline, while shipping a guaranteed-good reference track.

## How to Use

1. We've bundled a generated `simple_beat.wav` in this folder—swap in your own track if you'd like to experiment.
2. Load `simple_beat.bsm` in BeatSight (desktop build or future web client).
3. Play and inspect how the lanes line up with the heuristics.
